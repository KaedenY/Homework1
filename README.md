# Homework1 - Craft a Scene

1: My scene shows a snowy mountain village that is getting ready for the holiday season. The various objects I have are christmas related (presents, candy canes, christmas tree) and location relatred (snowy trees, mountain, village homes). My inspiration came from enjoying winter and enjoying the snowy atmosphere. The main character of the scene is a wolf entering the village. 

Objects;
- Wolf = asset
- Snowy trees = asset
- Primitive tree = I created using the unity primitive objects
- Regular tree = asset
- Presents = assets
- Houses = assets
- The brown house in the back = I created in blender (color mesh didnt come out right)
- skybox = assets
